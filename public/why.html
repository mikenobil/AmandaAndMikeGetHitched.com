	<p>As many of you know, Mike has been teaching me how to snowboard over the past few years. Two years ago, at Sierra-at-Tahoe Resort, Mike took me to the top of one of the peaks and said there was a nice long green (beginner) trail that I could do easily.</p>

	<p>Trusting completely that he knew me and my abilities, I said, "Oh, ok!"</p>

	<p>We get to a point in the trail right before a stretch of flat where we stop to rest, and Mike says to me, "By the way, you just did a blue (intermediate) trail with no problem." I was so psyched!</p>

	<p>This year, Mike brought me back and as we were gliding over the trees on the lift, headed to the same run, he said, "Hey, remember when I tricked you into going down that blue trail? That was this one, right?" I said that yes, I thought it was. He says, "Where exactly was it? Show me again?"</p>

	<p>And, not thinking anything of it, of course I said, "Oh, ok!"</p>

	<p>We set off down the run and stopped right before the flat part, in the same spot where the trees part enough to show a peek of the surrounding mountain vista. Kneeling in the snow, Mike turned to me where I was sitting and said, "You've taken so many leaps of faith with me."</p>

	<p>I replied, "I haven't seemed to have found a limit yet!"</p>

	<p>"Good," he says, "because..."--he pulls out a small black box--"...I'd like to ask you to take one more. Will you marry me?"</p>

	<p>I'm pretty sure, for a few minutes there, I completely forgot to breathe as I gaped first at the ring, then at Mike, then back at the ring, then back at Mike. Then--I have to admit--I burst into tears. Mike laughed and hugged me, then prompted me again, "Are you gonna say yes?"</p>

	<p>Blubbering and grinning like any classy dame, naturally I answered, "Of course! Yes, you a--hole!"</p>

	<p>And there it is.</p>

	<p>It's almost like you were there. ;)</p>
